## Nodejs web demo service

service\app.js is the main entry point. To run locally, please follow the instructions below

* install nodejs latest stable version
* do npm install under current, service and libs directory.
* run node app.js from directory service.
* the local end point will be available at http:\\localhost:3000\datacop\api\v1\heartbeat.


Note: There is a file package-lock.json mapping to every package.json file, I don't it is useful for our project. We can generate it every time we run "nom install".
